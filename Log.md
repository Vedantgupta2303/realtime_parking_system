Project update log:


1. Begin by adding a mp4 video to the project. Anyone who leverages the project to a CCTV monitoring would replace this with real-time footage.

2. Begin by extracting two images from the video, that will help the model to train finding empty spots on the particular site. NOTE: the frames must be rendered from the video after some time interval so sufficient number of cars have changed position during that time. 
(understand_site.py)

3. From the images taken in step 2, import images one by one and create dataset for  training and testing the CNN.


4. To detect, images = [cv2.imwrite(path) for path in glob.glob()].
   shape[0] = rows, shape[1] = columns
   for i in range(0, rows):
    for j in range(0, columns):
        if(image[i][j] == 0):
            count = count + 1
        total_count = total_count + 1
    if(count/total_count > 0.85):
        cv2.imwrite('', image)

Huge shoutout to Priya Dwivedi (https://towardsdatascience.com/find-where-to-park-in-real-time-using-opencv-and-tensorflow-4307a4c3da03) from whose work
the current work is inspired.

and Nimish Mishra 2nd year IIIT Kalyani for making things smooth for us and helping in this project
